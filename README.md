# rct_generalizability_flatiron

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to pragmatically reproduce landmark oncology randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and to assess their generalizability to patients in routine clinical practice. A total of 11 RCTs were reproduced across 4 different cancer types: advanced NSCLC, metastatic breast, metastaic prostate, and metastatic colorectal. 

Machine-learning (ML) survival models were specifically built for each of the 4 cancers. The ML models were used to create 3 prognostic risk groups. The landmark RCTs were then simulated for each risk group using inverse probability of treatment-weighted survival analyses.

Flatiron Health data was used to train and test the ML survival models and to reproduce the RCTs in-silico.
